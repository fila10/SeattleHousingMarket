# Seattle Housing Price Insights

## Project Overview

This project provides an interactive visualization of housing trends and rent prices in Seattle. Explore census tracts, analyze apartment prices, and gain insights into the city's housing market.

This project aims to analyze Seattle’s housing market by visualizing rental and housing price trends through various geospatial techniques. The primary focus will be on mapping rental price averages and house sale averages across different neighborhoods. By leveraging digital geography methods, including heat maps and point cluster visualizations, this project seeks to provide insights into spatial disparities, affordability, and market fluctuations in Seattle’s housing sector.

Rent statistics for apartments by census tract, ownership statistics for single family homes by census tract, median single family home price (nominative & per square foot), median rental prices (nominative & per square foot)
